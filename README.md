## Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries

### Objective
Use subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses to build advanced SQL logic.

### Tools
- MySQL Workbench

### What I Did
- Created multiple queries using different types of subqueries:
  - **Scalar Subquery** – compared each product’s price to the average product price.
  - **Subquery with IN / NOT IN** – found customers who placed or didn’t place orders.
  - **Correlated Subquery with EXISTS** – retrieved customers who made purchases above a certain amount.
  - **Subquery in FROM** – used a derived table to calculate top customers by total spending.
  - **Nested Subquery** – identified products ordered above average quantities.
  - **Subquery in HAVING** – filtered customers whose total orders exceeded the average order value.

### Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience with:
  - Scalar, correlated, and nested subqueries.
  - Using subqueries in different SQL clauses (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `FROM`, `HAVING`).
  - Writing multi-level logic for complex data retrieval.
- Strengthened understanding of **advanced query logic** and **data analysis using SQL**.
